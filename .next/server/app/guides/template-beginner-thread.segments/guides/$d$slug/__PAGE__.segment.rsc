4:T406,Title: [Pair] [Timeframe] – [Brief problem description]

---

Hi everyone,

I'm a [beginner/intermediate/advanced] trader and I'm having an issue with [what you're testing - EA name, indicator name, or trading approach].

**What I'm trying to do:**
[Describe your goal - e.g., "backtest a grid EA on XAUUSD M5" or "get this MA cross indicator to alert me"]

**What I've tried:**
- [First thing you tried]
- [Second thing you tried]
- [Third thing you tried, if applicable]

**The problem:**
[Describe exactly what's happening or not happening - e.g., "EA doesn't open any trades during backtest" or "indicator shows 'array out of range' error"]

**My setup:**
- Platform: [MT4 or MT5, build number if known]
- Pair: [XAUUSD, EURUSD, etc.]
- Timeframe: [M1, M5, H1, etc.]
- Broker: [Your broker name]
- Account: [Demo or Live]

**Question:**
[One specific question - e.g., "What strategy tester settings do I need to change?" or "Is this a coding error or user error?"]

[Attach screenshot if you have one]

Thanks for any help!
