Rename Categories and Simplify URLs
Current Problem: Your category names are too long and URLs are confusing. Search engines prefer short, keyword-rich URLs that clearly show what the page contains.​

Main Categories (keep URLs short and keyword-focused):

Display All URLs in Navigation
Why: Search engines crawl links in your navigation menu first. When all category URLs are visible in the top navigation, it helps:​

Google understand your site structure better​

Users find content faster

Pages get indexed quicker​

Implementation: Create a mega-menu dropdown that shows all main categories and subcategories with full URLs visible.​
