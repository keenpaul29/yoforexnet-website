6. `/api/content-studio/media/bulk-delete` - Delete multiple files
7. `/api/content-studio/media/search` - Search files by name or type
8. `/api/content-studio/media/stats` - Get storage statistics
9. `/api/content-studio/revisions` - Get content revision history
10. `/api/content-studio/revisions/:id` - Get specific revision details
11. `/api/content-studio/revisions/:id/restore` - Restore previous version
