our website URLs are like addresses for houses in a city. Let me explain the difference between what you have now and what you want:
Your Current URL (Flat Structure)
text
https://yoforex.net/category/scalping-m1-m15

This is like saying: "123 Main Street" - just a street address with no neighborhood or district information.
Your Desired URL (Hierarchical Structure)
text
https://yoforex.net/category/trading-strategies/scalping-m1-m15

This is like saying: "123 Main Street, Downtown District, New York City" - it shows where the house is AND what neighborhood it belongs to.
Why the Second One is Better (In Simple Terms)
1. Google Understands Your Content Better​
When Google's robots visit your website, the hierarchical URL tells them: "This scalping page is INSIDE the trading strategies section." The flat URL just says: "Here's a scalping page" with no context. It's like telling someone you live on Main Street versus telling them you live on Main Street in the Downtown District - the second gives much more helpful information.​
2. More Keywords = More Ways to Be Found​
Your new URL has TWO important keyword phrases instead of one:
"trading-strategies"
"scalping-m1-m15"
When someone searches Google for "forex trading strategies" OR "scalping strategies," your page has double the chances of appearing because both keywords are in your URL.​
3. Better Organization = Better Rankings​
Google loves organized websites. Think of it like a well-organized library versus a pile of books on the floor. The hierarchical structure shows Google that your forum is organized into neat sections, making it easier to understand and trust your site.​
4. Creates a Natural Path of Links​
With the hierarchical structure, you automatically create this path:
Homepage → Trading Strategies page → Scalping page
Each page passes "authority points" (think of it like recommendations) to the next page. The flat structure doesn't have this natural chain, so pages are isolated.​
5. Users Can Edit the URL to Navigate​
Smart users can remove /scalping-m1-m15 from the URL and hit Enter to see ALL trading strategies. With your flat structure, they'd have to manually find their way back. It's like being able to walk back one block versus having to ask for directions.​
6. Room to Grow​
As your forum grows, the hierarchical structure keeps things organized:
text
/category/trading-strategies/scalping-m1-m15
/category/trading-strategies/swing-trading
/category/trading-strategies/day-trading
/category/expert-advisors/mql4-coding
/category/expert-advisors/mql5-coding

Everything has its proper place. With flat URLs, you'd end up with 100+ categories all at the same level with no way to understand how they relate to each other.​
Real-World Analogy
Flat Structure = A massive warehouse where all products are scattered on one giant floor. You can find what you need, but it takes time and there's no logic to where things are.
Hierarchical Structure = A well-organized department store with clear sections (Electronics → Computers → Laptops). You know exactly where to go, and each section leads naturally to the next.
The Bottom Line
Your new hierarchical URL structure (/category/trading-strategies/scalping-m1-m15) helps:
Google understand your content better = higher rankings
Users navigate your site easier = better experience
Your website grow in an organized way = long-term success
The extra text in the URL (/trading-strategies/) isn't just filler - it's valuable information that helps both humans and search engines understand where they are on your site and what they're looking at.
