IMPORTANT NOTES FOR DEVELOPER
Keep Systems Separate:
Dashboard = Main admin homepage (existing design)


SEO System = Separate section (new system)


Link between them via "SEO & Marketing" menu item


Each system has independent navigation


Can be built and deployed separately


Data Sharing:
Both systems use same database


User sessions shared (same authentication)


Can cross-reference data between systems


API endpoints can be reused where applicable


Priority:
Dashboard: High (needed for daily operations)


SEO System: High (critical for growth)


Build simultaneously or Dashboard first, then SEO
