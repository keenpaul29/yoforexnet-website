## COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS: Build the Security & Safety Page

**WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING:**
You are creating a Security & Safety page for YoForex forum admin panel. This page monitors security events, manages IP bans, tracks performance metrics, detects threats, and provides tools to protect the forum from attacks and malicious activities.

***

## PART 1: BACKEND (Server Side - Security Monitoring)

### What the Backend Does
The backend logs all security events, manages IP blacklists, detects suspicious activities, monitors login attempts, and provides real-time security alerts.

### Create These Files:

**File 1: Security Routes (routes/security.js)**

Create URLs for security management:

1. `/api/security/events` - Get all security events
2. `/api/security/events/filter` - Filter events by type/severity
3. `/api/security/ip-bans` - Get all banned IPs
4. `/api/security/ip-bans/add` - Ban an IP address
5. `/api/security/ip-bans/:id/remove` - Remove IP ban
6. `/api/security/ip-bans/check` - Check if IP is banned
7. `/api/security/threats/detect` - Run threat detection scan
8. `/api/security/login-attempts` - Get failed login attempts
9. `/api/security/suspicious-activity` - Get suspicious activity log
10. `/api/security/two-factor/stats` - Get 2FA usage statistics
11. `/api/security/metrics` - Get security performance metrics
12. `/api/security/alerts/configure` - Configure security alerts
13. `/api/security/export` - Export security report
