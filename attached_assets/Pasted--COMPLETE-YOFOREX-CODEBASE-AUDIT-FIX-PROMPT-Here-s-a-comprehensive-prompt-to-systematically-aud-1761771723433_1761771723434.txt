 LEFT JOIN profiles p ON u.id = p.user_id
 WHERE p.user_id IS NULL;
-- Check coin balance consistency
 SELECT user_id,
 SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'credit' THEN amount ELSE -amount END) as calculated_balance,
 (SELECT balance FROM users WHERE id = coins.user_id) as stored_balance
 FROM coins
 GROUP BY user_id
 HAVING calculated_balance != stored_balance;
-- Check for orphaned posts
 SELECT p.id FROM posts p
 LEFT JOIN threads t ON p.thread_id = t.id
 WHERE t.id IS NULL;
-- Check for invalid foreign keys
 SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM users);
